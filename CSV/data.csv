It is an organisation of poor, vulnerable and every energetic Indian who believes in himself and has the courage to work  turn their big dream into  reality. These groups are those that  earn a living through their own labour or small businesses. They do not obtain regular salaried employment with welfare benefits like workers in the organised sector. However their work is not counted and hence remains invisible. In fact, unorganized workers themselves remain uncounted, under counted and invisible.   SEWA’s main goals are to organize vulnerable workers for full employment. Full employment means employment whereby workers obtain work security, income security, food security and social security (at least health care, child care and shelter). SEWA organises vulnerable section to ensure that every family obtains full employment. By self-reliance we mean that everyone will be autonomous and self-reliant, individually and collectively, both economically and in terms of their decision-making ability.   At SEWA we organise workers to achieve their goals of full employment and self reliance through the strategy of struggle and development. The struggle is against the many constraints and limitations imposed on them by society and the economy, while development activities strengthen bargaining power and offer them new alternatives. Practically, the strategy is carried out through the joint action of union and cooperatives. Gandhian thinking is the guiding force for SEWA’s poor, self-employed members in organising for social change.   SEWA is both an organisation and a movement. The SEWA movement is enhanced by its being a sangam or confluence of three movements: the labour movement, the cooperative movement and self empowerment movement. But it is also a movement of self-employed workers: their own, home-grown movement. Through their own movement their tremendous economic and social contributions become recognised with globalization, liberalization and other economic changes, there are both new opportunities as well as threats to some traditional areas of employment.   More than ever, our members are ready to face the winds of change. They know that they must organise to build their own strength and to meet challenges. There are still millions  who remain in poverty and are exploited, despite their long hours of hard labour. They bear the brunt of the changes in our country and must be brought into the mainstream, so as to avail of the new opportunities that are developing with regard to employment.   Also there is much to be done in terms of strengthening women’s leadership, their confidence, their bargaining power within and outside their homes and their representation in policy-making and decision-making fore. It is their issues, their priorities and needs which should guide and mould the development process in our country. Toward this end, SEWA has been supporting its members in capacity-builiding and in developing their own economic organisations.",2014,http://www.guidestarindia.org/Summary.aspx?CCReg=9243

For the period 2016-2017, we decided to focus primarily on waste management. This was carried forward to the subsequent period of 2017-2018 as well. It was, and still continues to be, a challenge for us since both the authorities and the public chose to be ignorant of waste management. Also, with no funds or contributions, the challenge became more vexing. However, with much effort, we have been able to achieve our goal of utilising plastic waste to make road. Since December 2017, we have been able to make three small stretches of plastic roads, viz., two in Dimapur and one in Mokokchung.

It was in the year 1942, the time when the father of our nation Mahatma Gandhi called for Quit India movement throughout undivided India. To get the freedom along with many people in Bengal the small village Ajaya under Khejuri Block was also rolled on in that wave. Some noble and freedom fighter established a club to worship ‘Bhartmata’ (an embodiment of India). This club finally resulted to main centre in northern Khejuri Block and some more men and women formed an association, locally named as “Sarboday Sangha”   (meant  overall progress or welfare of all). Till Independence ie. 1947 and some years later after 1947 the primary function was to worship “Bharatmata” which continued till 1969.In1971 the youth of the second generation felt the need of a full-fledge voluntary Organisation in the remote village of Ajaya which can play as a pivot for the development of the village community as a whole. Thus the Sangha was renamed as “Sarboday Sangha” and was registered under W. B Society Registration act as Voluntary Organisation. On the due course of time this Institution developed as a pioneer socio-development Organisation in undivided Khejuri block and always trying for the betterment of all categories of people with a special emphasis on women and child development. From the beginning till date we face lots of hindrances and obstacles. Sometimes we accept that is not so much easy to operate but the dire need of the community inspired and we again start fighting. Now at the middle we do not even think to turn back but we have a high hope within a few years few dreams will be fulfilled.",1971,http://www.guidestarindia.org/Summary.aspx?CCReg=7672
