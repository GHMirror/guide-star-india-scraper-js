  "briefDescription": "The GFCH (India) will endeavour for a paradigm shift in thinking from the now prevailing notion of tolerance of other faiths as the ideal to the ideal of acceptance of all faiths as valid and sacred to achieve peace and harmony based on mutual accommodation. Such re-orientation of thinking will promote positive complementarity among faiths and cultures, rather than reluctant and condescending tolerance of each other. The GFCH (India) perceives a need for a thorough review of the benchmarks used to define the world's self-image. The GFCH (India) will prepare the non-proselytizing, non-conflicting faiths for a global dialogue among themselves and also between them and the others.",
