  "briefDescription": "Sakaar Outreach is a voluntary social organization registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. Founded in 2001 by like minded people who joined hands for a common mission.We at Sakaar Outreach through our various outreach programmes have been providing vocational training to empower a segment of the population that is economically backward, marginalised and without sources of education or health care facilities. We also endeavor to impart training in popular trades like Computer fundamentals, Beauty Culture, Cutting & Tailoring and Dress Making to our beneficiaries so that they become directly employable and gain economic independence in the long term.  Sakaar Outreach is running fifteen centers in New Delhi, Haryana, UttarPradesh, Gujarat.For twelve years Sakaar Outreach has endeavoured to make an impact by working with the weaker and more vulnerable sections of the society  and its main focus is on education, women empowerment, health care facilities and HIV/AIDS prevention and cure along with community development.",
