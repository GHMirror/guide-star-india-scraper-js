  "briefDescription": "Tiljala Society for Human and Educational Development [TSHED], is a non-government developmental organization established in 1987. We work in Kolkata [Calcutta] with residents of slum communities, squatters, and pavement dwellers. The primary strength of our organization is that it is an initiative for our people, by our people. The grassroots origin of the organization and its continued principle to serve the people both through our projects and via direct employment of locals into the organization means that our vision and purpose is continually re-evaluated and reinforced. The organizationâ€™s grassroots strength, perseverance and impact have gained both government and international recognition over the past two and a half decades of its operation.",
