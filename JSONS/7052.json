  "briefDescription": "Access Life Assistance Foundation discovered a huge unmet need to provide a safe and clean atmosphere for children to recover during their Cancer treatment. These children, along with their families, travel to Mumbai from remote towns and villages, in the hope of being treated at hospitals such as Tata Memorial, LTMGH (Sion Hospital), Wadia Hospital, Nair Hospital etc. where they receive free of charge treatment.But they have no place to stay, and many end up on the footpath, or paying dearly for unhygienic accommodation. Unhygienic living conditions, lack of psychosocial support, lack of proper nutrition and weakened immune systems will lead to lower survival rate.At Access Life, we provide free of cost accommodation with hygienic and high quality living environment for the children and their parents.",
