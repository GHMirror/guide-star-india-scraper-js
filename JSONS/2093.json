  "briefDescription": "We at EUWS believe in the fact that helping is not simply a matter of dispersing money but of making a deep, long-term commitment and casting a hard eye on results. With this view in mind, we are trying in capacity building, training the youths to gradually sustain and scale up themselves and their activities. The entire management and operation of EUWS is in compliance with the principles of “Good Governance” and thus sets itself apart with its set norms of sustainability, scalability, accountability, transparency, credibility and effective leadership.",
