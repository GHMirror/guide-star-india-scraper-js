  "briefDescription": "Divya Kiran Sewa Sansthan was founded by a group of committed social activists who were concerned about the inequalities prevalent in society. The group of activists conducted sporadic social welfare activities in remote and rural areas of Jhunjhunu district in Rajasthan. In the course of their voluntary action, the activists realized that there is larger need for concerted and collective efforts to reduce the gap between the privileged and the lesser privileged sections of the society. Thus Divya Kiran Sewa Sansthan was established as a Non-Governmental volunteer organization to cater to the unserved and under-served communities, with focus on the most vulnerable groups.",
