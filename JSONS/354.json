  "briefDescription": "Dr. Shroff's Charity Eye Hospital is one of the best super-specialty eye care institutions in North India, offering its services across all economic sections of the society. Today it offers quality Eye and ENT care across the various locations at New Delhi, Alwar, Saharanpur, Lakhimpur Kheri and Vrindavan. The hospital has adopted the cross-subsidy model, wherein 50% of surgeries would be done free of cost for the poor. While the revenue earned through the paid work helps the hospital to meet its running expenses, donors and funding agencies help us to undertake the free work for the poor. Last financial year (2017 â€“ 18)nearly 500000 people were examined at SCEH, out of which 32090 surgeries were done. Out of the total surgeries 16399 (5 1.1%) were done free or highly subsidized to the underprivileged section of the society.",
