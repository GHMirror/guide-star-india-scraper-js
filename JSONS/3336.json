  "briefDescription": "In the recent years, the Internet has become a source you turn to for any kind of information and medical information in particular. When you approach a doctor,  you trust and believe that he/she  will give you the most appropriate medication or treatment.  Interestingly, while every professional talks of \"information overload\", the medical curriculum does not teach health professionals to search medical literature in a systematic manner. As a result it is not impossible that they come across unreliable sources or outdated evidence. This obviously is not safe for patient care.  As patients if you donâ€™t know enough about sources, you are at the risk of  trusting information that may not be authentic.  To bridge this gap in the medical information space, we train health science professionals to search medical literature and cite it correctly. In the past five years we have delivered over a 100 lectures and conducted over 100workshops in medical institutions across India, reaching out to more than 2500+ health science professionals. We conduct awareness lectures for health consumers - sensitizing them about right resources to get relevant medical information, thus helping them to be informed and active participants in the treatment process.",
