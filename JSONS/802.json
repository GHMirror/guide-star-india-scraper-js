  "briefDescription": "SummaryFaced by a lack of resources and expertise, high-potential education NGOs are often unable to maximize their impact. Atma's Accelerator Program helps education NGOs in Mumbai to build their capacity so that they reach out to more children.What is the issue, problem, or challenge?We know that NGO leaders in Mumbai have the vision and passion, but there's only so much they can do on their own. More than anything else, education NGOs need management expertise so that they can reach out to more children.How will this project solve this problem?NGOs selected for the Accelerator Program receive three years of consultancy support in 10 Organisational Development (OD) areas like Administration, Finance, Fundraising, Monitoring & Evaluation, Human Resources, Governance, Leadership, Strategy, Development, Programs and Marketing. They also receive support from three skilled volunteers and one partner manager to work on projects in different OD areas.Potential Long Term ImpactThrough the Accelerator Program, NGOs are able to attract a better talent pool, increase their fundraising capacity and reach out to more children. Since 2007, Atma has worked with 62 education NGOs and reached out to 16.4 Lakh children in Mumbai.",
