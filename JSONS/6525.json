  "briefDescription": "empowHER India (legal entity: SKS Chakshu Foundation) has initiated and established a strong movement to bring women together to lead social transformation in the villages of the Panvel Taluka. Our continuous engagement with the communities made us realize that women are the catalysts who could help transform villages. The first step to empower women was to provide them access to her basic needs i.e. toilets, clean drinking water, education and access to funds which will lead to greater security and a brighter future for her family. We have initiated women-led and women-centric interventions since 2007. We work on:Women EmpowermentWater, Sanitation and HygieneEducation",
