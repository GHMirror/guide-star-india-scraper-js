  "briefDescription": "Founded in 1998, Apne Aap Womenâ€™s Collective (AAWC) is an anti-trafficking organisation that serves the women in brothel-based prostitution and their children in the red light districts of Kamathipura and Falkland Road, Mumbai. By providing our beneficiaries with the tools and resources to create a better quality of life, we seek to empower women who have been trafficked into brothel-based prostitution and to prevent the inter-generational cycle of prostitution among their daughters. Since 1998, we have served more than 3,000 women and children with alumni having earned Bachelor's and Master's degrees and entered mainstream professions like accounting, hospitality management, luxury cuisine, nursing, photography, retail, social work, and teaching.
