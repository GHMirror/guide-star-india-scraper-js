Our presence is essential because there continues to be societal problems poverty, inequities, marginalisation, lack of access to services, and lack of voice. Most of the solutions are isolated and less integrated. Our key motivation and belief is that livelihood security and approaches can be great levers toaddress poverty, marginalisation and inclusive development.We, as social entrepreneurs, don't leave it to the government or people themselves to solve it;",
