  "briefDescription": "Fatima Old Age Home was established in 2014, with a concrete intention to provide care to the neglected grandparents of our secular community, alleviating suffering and help them age with dignity and grace.Most of the grandparents sheltered in our old age home are widows and have been \"deposited\" by their children; who either do not want to take care of them or cannot take care of them due to this eraâ€™s hectic lifestyle.We provide them with the much needed care, food, bed, basic medical coverage, physiotherapy and clothing, with companionship, emotional support, and recreation facilities to overcome social isolation. We currently care for 28 destitute grandparents. We have a capacity for caring for 60 grandparents",
