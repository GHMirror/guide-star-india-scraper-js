  "briefDescription": "By the realistic  portrayal some rogues of both rural and urban expose their deep hatred against such poor, down trodden, outcast, half starved, half literate poor, tribal and minority communities to fulfill their own serpent interest. But the undaunted ‘ACTS’ M I N I S T R IE S’ is acting as the auspicious mouth piece of such exploited and deprived classes from the beginning of its origin.Our motto is to formulate the four wings of education like physical, spiritual, cognitive and socio- emotional. Its analytical geometry is to create curiosity, among the inquisitiveness tender minds, to investigation, exploration in such belief that the widened horizon of knowledge must sustain our next generation a dynamic life in near future.",
