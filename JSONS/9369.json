A group of likeminded, committed and distinguished social workers organized a meeting on 20th  August 1988 and discussed the emerging social and economic backwardness of the marginalized,  disadvantaged and the most vulnerable communities  in Tirunelveli district.  They decided to register an organization called ‘Arasan Vidhyalaya’ and later renamed the organization into ‘Arasan Rural Development Society’ to suit their vision and mission.       The basic aims and objectives of the organization facilitate and guide the rural and urban poor",
