  "briefDescription": "Living For Environment (LiFE), based in Dimapur, Nagaland, was formed in the year 2016 by 7 like-minded individuals to take proactive action in the protection, preservation and conservation of environment, as well as play an active role in the civil society’s development by incorporating the principle of sustainable development. Two areas that we have been very keen on, since the beginning, is the accumulation of waste and its disposal, which is causing irremediable damage not only on the environment, but the health of the people as well; and organic farming. For the period 2016-2017, we decided to focus primarily on waste management. This was carried forward to the subsequent period of 2017-2018 as well. It was, and still continues to be, a challenge for us since both the authorities and the public chose to be ignorant of waste management. Also, with no funds or contributions, the challenge became more vexing. However, with much effort, we have been able to achieve our goal of utilising plastic waste to make road. Since December 2017, we have been able to make three small stretches of plastic roads, viz., two in Dimapur and one in Mokokchung. This has been made possible because of sponsors.  Our work with plastic road has served a number of people, and hence the number of beneficiaries cannot be estimated.",
