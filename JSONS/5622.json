We are supporting almost 175 poor children every year and we provided entirely free of cost education, uniforms, educational materials and mid-day meals every working days. Because of this areas people are economically very poor, daily wages, labourers, they are living hand to mouth and they are busy earning their daily bread. Our school is recognised by govt.in unaided basis so we are not getting any grant, help or support from govt.and school is fully managed by own resources.",
