  "briefDescription": "SAHAYOG works very closely with grass root women's organization and adolescent groups comprising of rural and marginalized communities such as Dalits, tribals, poor, rural and minorities. SAHAYOG raises awareness and builds the capacities of women, men, adolescent girls, boys and youth  from these marginalised communities about their rights and entitlements.  This enables the marginalized women and youth to monitor various government schemes and generate grassroot evidence. The grassroot evidence generated is shared with block, district and state level officials during dialogues with the objective of advocating for the provision of improved services. There are 12000 women and 4000 adolescent girls, ...youth, .... men associated with SAHAYOG through its various programmes.",
