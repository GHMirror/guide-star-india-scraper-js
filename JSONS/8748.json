  "briefDescription": "Sethu is a charitable trust committed to the development of children, based in India’s smallest state of Goa, just south of Maharashtra.  Since its inception 11 years ago, Sethu has grown from an idea to an organic vibrant center that strongly believes that every child, despite whatever challenges they may face deserves to reach their full potential. Sethu's multi-disciplinary team works with children with a range of developmental, emotional, learning and behavioural challenges by building bridges of hope and understanding between child, family, teachers and society.  Children between the ages of 0 – 19 years old come to the center, which is currently a rented residential house.",
