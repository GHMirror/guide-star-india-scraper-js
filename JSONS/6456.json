Most of the details regarding the trust, trustees, patients, etc are available online. We network with NPOs, Insts, corporate, hospitals, and Drs to restore vision to patients belonging to the under privileged sections of society anywhere in India. We follow a stringent process of due diligence to ensure that aid (surgery, medication, etc) is provided to the poor and needy thereby turning them into socially responsible/employable citizens who ultimately become a part of social sustainability and inclusive growth",
