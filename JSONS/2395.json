  "briefDescription": "The primary intention of Formedia is to promote and support the capacity building of professional media cadre and the development of media literacy in civil society. This is aimed at covering the gap between achieving the Millennium Development Goals and commensurate creative content for broadcast and non-broadcast outreach. It is targeted for increasing cultural diversity in media content. Formedia sees its place in that space where issue-based communication has a human interest face instead of figures; where people can access information more easily; and the media is motivated to increase its interest in issues that concern larger sections of the society instead of the privileged and also move away from purely sensationalist issues. Formedia is keenly interested in Environment, Population, Health, Ethnic Communities, Women, Education and Culture.",
