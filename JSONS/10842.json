  "briefDescription": "Travancore National School is one of the pioneers in imparting comprehensive educational care for children with SLD, Slow Learning, ADHD, ADD, Intellectual Disability, Mild Behavioural Problems, Autistic Spectrum Disorder etc. located at Thiruvananthapuram, the State Capital of Kerala. Travancore National School is the result of a motherâ€™s determination to help her son and other gifted students like him. We are the first institution to introduce a 6:1 ratio teaching methodology instead of inclusive education for students with learning disabilities. Our student teacher ratio and remedial method of teaching are the highlights of our curriculum.",
