  "briefDescription": "A group of young social workers had an idea to form a registered association when they served in different organizations, from where they gathered experience since 1985. They realized the need to start an organization, which would stand for the rural depressed women and their community development. This resulted in the establishment of NALANTHA EDUCATIONAL TRUST(NET), which was registered under the Indian public Trust ACT of Tamil Nadu Government and also registered under the 12 AA of Income tax Act of Government Of India. The organization has very good infrastructure and facilities in its campus of Anbalaya to undertake various initiatives and social development programs.",
