  "briefDescription": "MFORCHANGE a non-profit entity with primary focus on bridging the gap between technology and social change. It was founded on the belief that there is considerable gap between the technology that is available on hand and people it can serve. We believe that by providing the right information at the right time to the right people, we can bring about change in people's lives. Over years, we have accumulated a lot of data about incidents of Violence Against Women in India, helplines for addressing Domestic Violence, Helplines for Autistic Kids, helplines for Animal Rights actvists, information about kennels, etc. We are a purely volunteer driven organization with limited resources and believe that through volunteering we can bring about change",
