  "briefDescription": "Christ Faith Home for Children is a secular,social service organization(NGO), dedicated service to the needy sections of the society,especially destitute Children, deserted Women, abandoned babies and helpless old women. For the past 3 decades, CFHC has reaching out to the needy with an aim to help every deserving, helpless and suffering people as much as possible. We find the strength and wherewithal to help people in the face of myriad obstacles and financial challenges to achieve our goals. With a narrowed view to meet the needs of the orphaned and abandoned children and to show the love of God by holding, feeding, educating, caring for and rescuing them from the evil of their circumstances \"Christ Faith Home for Children\" was founded by Dr.Lion Mrs. Maida Raja. CFHC activities are framed on the belief that an organization like ours should do more than just provide temporary material relief to the suffering. CFHC support is designed to give people the means to provide for their own welfare for the rest of their lives. This makes them not to remain dependent on the hands-outs of a charity. ‘Instead of giving fish to the starving, teach them how to catch fish’.",
