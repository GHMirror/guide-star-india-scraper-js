  "briefDescription": "Swayam is a feminist organisation committed to advancing women's rights and ending inequality and violence against women and their children. We facilitate the empowerment of women survivors of violence taking into account their psychological, emotional, physical and economic needs and providing them with variety of support services, with the ultimate objective of enabling them to become self-sufficient and economically independent. We also generate discussion, debate and action in society with the aim of challenging and changing societal norms and values that deem violence against women acceptable; mobilise community support for women and help them access their rights; campaign, network and advocate for changes at the socio-legal and policy levels.",
