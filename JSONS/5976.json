Dhawale, an eminent clinician, author and educationist in the field of Homoeopathy. It is closely associated with ICR, established in 1975 by Dr. M. L. Dhawale to further the work of Homoeopathy. We started our journey with the purpose of reaching homoeopathic care to the marginalizedin 1990 at Kurar Village, Malad. A 50 bedded Palghar hospital was built in year 2000 to serve the rural and tribal people in the vicinity. On a gifted land of the local well-wisher in Bhopoli (Tal: Vikramgadh), we built 10 bedded cottage hospital to serve the tribal community. We at MLD trust work on the model of positive health, which is not mere absence of disease but a vibrant sense of well being. We serve an area covering 50 lakh people, most of them with no access to healthcare facilities. The services are spread in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka. Dr. M. L.
