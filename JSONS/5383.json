  "briefDescription": "Gyanada Foundation is a new NGO based in Singapore and India that provides a private school education to Indian girls from disadvantaged backgrounds. We support students from marginalized sections of society to attend low-cost but relatively high quality private school. We believe educating girls is the necessary first step a family can take to emerge from poverty. Hence, we work with educational non-profits in India to put girls through good, low-cost private schools near their homes. In the first year we have supported 124 girls to access quality education at budget private schools in Kolkata, Delhi, and Ranchi for 2012-2013 academic year.",
