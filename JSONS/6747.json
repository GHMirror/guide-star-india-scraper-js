  "briefDescription": "The MCF works to engage and empower young people to become the agents of change and development for their communities. By giving young people a voice and a vision for how they can act to improve their lives and the lives of others, we seek to transform rural mountain communities from the ground up. We are currently working throughout Uttarakhand and have engaged thousands of children in this effort. We help them build leadership and communication skills, tap into their idealism to create a vision of a community that does not discriminate on the basis of gender, socieoeconmic status, caste, religion, ability, etc. Most of all,help them realize they cannot wait for government or NGOs to make things happen - they must do it themselves!",
