The idea to build a caste and classless society having exploitation free social structure, was initially conceived after the social services rendered by Nilfer Quazi and Sushila Choudhary  in the both rural and urban areas. The aim of NSS is to empower people socially, economically, politically and to bridge the gap by providing help and support to the poor and downtrodden in the field of women and children health, education and livelihood which would subsequently link them with the mainstream society.",
