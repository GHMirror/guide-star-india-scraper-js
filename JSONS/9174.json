  "briefDescription": "We started our journey after seeing tribal children working in small shops and hotels. There we thought to do something for our society as we always took something from it. There we started Umang Foundation. 3 years ago, there was no name of recognition of our work as we didn't work on paper. Now we are working for our Environment, educating children, providing training under PMKVY, working for Swachchh Bharat Abhiyan and empowering women.Also we provide free medical health checkup camp where general ambulance can't go.",
