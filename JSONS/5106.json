  "briefDescription": "We take the opportunity to introduce ourselves as EQUINOX FOUNDATION (NGO), whose aim is to provide Dental Checkup, Skill Training, Career development camps, Entrepreneurship development programme  etc. for poor and marginalized   class people. Since 2010, we are working with the poor and marginalized communities of Maharashtra. We are working with local communities to address collectively the peopleâ€™s movements, poverty, inequity and injustice.We are reaching out with the target groups, through SHGs (Self-Help Groups) of which, mostly are poor and marginalized, and supporting them in their struggle to access their rights to work, education, healthcare and helping them for their livelihood.The communities we work include poor and marginalized other sections of the rural poor, women, children, and minorities. Within these groups, our focus is on people in most vulnerable situations such as ill health, children out of education, persons with disability and people affected by natural and human-made disasters.As we are working with the Tribal and other backward communities in Thane, Wardha, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Bhandara, Nagpur and other districts of the State of Maharashtra, hence we would like to propose the welfare program for the children, youth and the women from the said areas.",
