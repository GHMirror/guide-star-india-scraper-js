For children attending schools run by the Municipal Corporation in both cities, the organization offers direct intervention supporting the process of learning.  The Door Step School also has other supportive programs for further educational development of these children. Today the organizationâ€™s annual outreach exceeds 1,10,000 children altogether in both cities.",
