  "briefDescription": "We run Sharpshooters - a Football Academy for slum children which uses the sport to combat gutkha addiction among the slum youth & inculcate values of health, cleanliness, punctuality etc. Also, achieving in the sport gives them added confidence and an opportunity for a better life. We are right now working with over 100 youth whom we divide into teams according to age groups and field them in local tournaments with some success. This includes a group of girls from lower economic backgrounds who're provided educational, nutritional & sporting  support to ensure the game itself ensures a life path ahead.",
