  "briefDescription": "Sahyadri Nisarga Mitra was born when a few likeminded people wanted to do more than sigh away their pangs of conscience about the rampant abuse of nature. The day was 12th Feb. 1992. Out of the brainstorming of these individuals, the aim to \"Broaden the vision of nature conservation\" was taken up as the mission of this Organisation.Activities of the initial years like Saving Indian Swiftlets on Vengurla Rocks, White-bellied sea eagle survey contributed to build a solid base of volunteers in the Konkan region.  From 2002, Turtle (Olive Ridley) conservation has become a flagship project which is being executed in more than 30 villages on the Konkan coast. SNM has empowered the local population through training, eco-tourism. Developed homestay with training to the community which is a now livelihood option in the region. Currently working for the conservation of Indian Pangolin a most trafficked mammal in the world through Study and awareness. Last two years working in the agriculture sector with advanced training to farmers. Also working in Eye donation and many more.",
