  "briefDescription": "Established in 1973, Apnalaya works with communities to provide a better quality of life. At present interventions are focused in Shivaji Nagar and Bainganwadi in M East Ward of Mumbai (Govandi) where life expectancy, literacy rates and per capita income are the lowest recorded in the city. Apnalayaâ€™s approach in these most vulnerable communities is one of integrated community development based on the principles of partnership and participation. Programmes presently run for the communities living on and around the Deonar Garbage Dumping Ground many of whom are engaged in rag picking activities which are: health and disability,  gender and livelihood, education and citizenship.",
