  "briefDescription": "Olakh (Gujarati for 'Identity') is a feminist organization established in 1993 to challenge the patriarchal mindsets and structures of power relations manifested in gender, caste, class, religion and ethnicity. Olakh strives to create a just and peaceful society, considering all prevailing violence, discrimination and injustice that the society renders to its vulnerable sections. During the last 20 years, we have encompassed different activities and programs, such as providing counseling to survivors of violence, gender trainings, campaigns against violence against women, running a resource center with a library and engaging youth in social action.
