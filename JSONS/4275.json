  "briefDescription": "We believe that the world is a place where blindness is not a handicap, but just a mere inconvenience.In April 2000 Voice Vision was established with this idea as a driving principle. And even today, we continue to provide a vision, not only to the visually impaired by imparting lessons on technological accessibility, but also to the sighted, by giving them an eye to witness the change, and thereby garner an increasing acceptance in today's society.",
