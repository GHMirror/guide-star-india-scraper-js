  "briefDescription": "Bunyaad Foundation came into being with a clear mandate of reaching out to the underprivileged rural and urban youth and inculcate in them a spirit of reaching heights with whatever resources they have. Our aim is to help rural youth have that escape velocity which causes them to escape the gravitational pull that holds them back and the tendency to believe that achieving heights is not our cup of tea but of the elite and the belief that all worldly comforts are meant for the elite, we are here to break this myth.",
