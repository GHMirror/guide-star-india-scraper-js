  "briefDescription": "Jan Grammen Vikas Sansthan was established in 1989, under the society registration act 21, 1860. The eastern UP (organizational working area Azamgarh and Ghazipur is a part of eastern UP) has a different social and economic structure. There is a clear unequal division of power and resources, which is centered among the upper caste people.  On the other hands, the deprived community has nor the power nor the resources. ‘Social justice’ and with ‘Rights & Entitlements’ are the dream for the poor.  The chief functionary Mrs. Vimla Maurya, who comes from the backward community, has also the victims of the exploitation and social inequality. She faces these situations many times.",
