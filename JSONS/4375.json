  "briefDescription": "CORO (Committee of Resource Organizations) for Literacy is a community-owned organization working on holistic community development throughout Maharashtra and some parts of Rajasthan. Three elements are at the heart of how CORO operates: 1.CORO’s work is entirely directed by the needs and desires of its communities. Community members have identified these priorities to be addressing domestic violence and access to basic services (water, sanitation, solid waste disposal), education, health services, and housing.2.As soon as it began its work, CORO realized that women were both the most oppressed members of the communities and the most potent and energized drivers of change. Thus, CORO focuses on empowering these women and approaches community development with a concentration on gender equality.3.CORO’s activities are always rooted in building community members� awareness of their rights and equipping them with the skills to claim and exercise them. As a result, cultivating grassroots leaders through training and capacity building has become CORO’s niche. Because of this emphasis, CORO’s staff is all from communities within CORO’s work area.CORO’s “Unique Demonstrative Proposition� is its competence in training grassroots leaders. It is based on understanding that CORO has acquired in the past 29 years about:1.Urban community issues2.Strategies that truly work at the grassroots3.Community dynamics and politics4.How to identify potential leaders5.How to create support structures for collective leadership in the grassroots7.Tools for bridging gaps between macro-concepts and micro-realities",
