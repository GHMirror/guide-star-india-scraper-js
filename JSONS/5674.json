  "briefDescription": "HAQ: Centre for Child Rights works through its two main programmes- Children and Governance and Child Protection. It works as a resource and support base providing information, referral service, legal aid, training and capacity building of all those working with children or on issues concerning them, and the children themselves. While our advocacy and policy change work impacts the life of all children in the country, through our direct work on support to child sexual abuse victims, our counselling and legal aid, juvenile justice and child marriage interventions we reach over 250 children every year and about 1000 community members in two states of West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh.",
