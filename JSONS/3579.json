  "briefDescription": "PARIVARTAN, was founded in 1996 by Shri C S Juyal, being a forced migrator from his home land due lack of jobs and basic requirements, he always wanted to work in the direction of developing his home land and develop it as a more livable place, where people don't need to leave their homes in search of good lives, so the main motive of ours is to stop migration, women empowerment and child/youth development & selfemployment generation. We have served more than 1000 villages so far where we are trying to make these villages socialy and economicaly strong. we are working to improve health conditions by improving sanitation and motivating villagers to build toilets and avoid open defecation, we are providing clear and pure water supply to them",
