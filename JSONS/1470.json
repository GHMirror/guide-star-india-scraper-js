  "briefDescription": "•\tMurshidabad, in the state of west Bengal is earmarked as one of the most backward district, with a major population of backward Muslim community, schedule casts, schedule tribes, and other backward classes.  Here children in the age group of 9 to 14 are engaged as child laborers in hotels, shops, agricultural firms and rickshaw pullers. These helpless kids require care and protection. Valuable human resources are being nipped in the bud. Their pathetic, pitiable and appalling conditions moved me and  I dedicated myself to form a  society, KARNASUBARNA WELFARE SOCIETYAt the beginning of the year 2006 I held several meetings with some reputed personalities of the locality and after a great deal of deliberation a committee was formed with the participation of 1.
