  "briefDescription": "Brother Siga Animation Centre (BSAC) is a secular non-governmental organsation which was started in 1984 by a group of committed young men who were interested in imparting the leadership skills they had themselves acquired under the mentorship of Br. Sigamani, a Salesian Priest working in the Vysarpadi.  The group was concerned about the high rates of illiteracy, unemployment amidst the communities in their locality.  The focus of the work has been mostly on children and youth.",
