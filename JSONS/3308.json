  "briefDescription": "One of the most challenging aspects of teaching a child with special needs is the realization that this child has come to our centre with a mission which will be a part of. It is for us to discover this and serve the child in our journey together.The programs offered by V-Excel Educational Trust are designed to address this. In understanding that education can be healing, we have a variety of interventions to offer under our umbrella organization. Making every moment of teaching alive and real for the children, different therapies, assessments, support systems, such as counseling and psychotherapy, medical services, and remedial programs are some of the tools that we use. We work towards advocacy for equal rights, full inclusion in society, independent living, self-determination and employment for individuals with special needs.V-Excel Educational Trust strives to provide a healthy and nurturing environment for self-development and building trusting relationships.We have a team of dedicated, motivated and committed teaching staff, who aim to work with the child as their centre and serve in the best interest of the childâ€™s needs.",
