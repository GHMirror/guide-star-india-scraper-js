  "briefDescription": "Brothers Integrated Rural Development Society (BIRDS) is the Social work organ of The Sacred Heart Brothers society, established in the year 1997 with the primary motto of serving the marginalized communities in Rural and Urban areas. The Sacred Heart Brothers is a registered society under Karnataka Societies Registration Act with Regn No. 3/77-78. In the initial years the society was responding to the day-to-day needs of the poor and engaged in much charitable work in the rural areas of Bangalore. Later in the year 1997 a focused intervention with overall community-based development was felt by the brothers and hence BIRDS was established to exclusively work for the empowerment of the poor and marginalized.",
