  "briefDescription": "Our mission is to improve quantitative and qualitative education in backward villages thus transforming children to become quality individuals to help form a more complete society and thus a more complete INDIA. Currently we adopted 4 villages which accounts for about 350 students in total. Our model is to adopt backward villages, develop the education quantitatively and qualitatively (from ground/root level) until the villages become self-sustaining, and then put these villages in monitoring phase and go on to other villages. Our work is 2-fold in our adopted villages:1.(Qualitative) Work towards childrens' growth in academics, sports, arts, personality, health.2.(Quantitative) Mobilize villagers (esp. parents) for a permanent change.",
