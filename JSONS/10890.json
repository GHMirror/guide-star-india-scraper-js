  "briefDescription": "Golden Butterflies Children’s Palliative Care Foundation, Chennai was registered on February 8th, 2018, as a not-for-profit, public charitable trust. We are dedicated to serving the needs of underprivileged children suffering from chronic, advanced or incurable diseases like cancer, AIDS and end-stage organ failure, in Chennai city and its surrounding districts in Tamil Nadu, by providing palliative care, counselling, nutritional support and financial assistance. Our support extends to the family/caregivers as well, as we believe the well-being (physical, emotional, and spiritual) of the entire family must be considered. We also aim to raise awareness about children’s palliative care among the general community.",
