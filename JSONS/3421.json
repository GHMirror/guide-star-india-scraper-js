  "briefDescription": "V Care Foundation V Care Foundation is a voluntary support group dedicated to providing free help, hope, awareness and education to cancer patients and their families through outreach programs and services that improve the quality of their lives.  V Care was founded by Mrs. Vandana Gupta, a cancer survivor herself, in 1993. With 22 years of dedicated service, V Care understands that cancer can affect anyone whether through a personal diagnosis or through that of a friend, family member or neighbor.  V Care aims to be with cancer patients and their families, every step of the way, from diagnosis to cure, to help them manage all aspects of their lives. As part of our commitment to Survivors, and the Spirit of Hope and Courage, we organize annually, a “Cancer Survivors' Day” event to reiterate our belief that cancer is curable and that one can lead a meaningful life even after a diagnosis of cancer. Originally started by V Care, Cancer Survivors' Day(CSD) is now celebrated throughout India by other cancer support groups.",
