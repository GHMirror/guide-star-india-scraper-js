  "briefDescription": "Janaagraha is a non-profit organisation based in Bangalore, India. We seek to improve quality of life in Urban India by fixing the country’s ‘City Systems’ – laws, policies, institutions, and governance frameworks that directly underlie quality of life. As an organisation we work with both citizens and government to catalyse this systemic change using three scale models – Partnerships, Platforms, and Policies. Our work is guided by the City Systems Framework which provides the blueprint for world class cities through its four dimensions:• Urban Planning & Design• Urban Capacities & Resources• Empowered & Legitimate Political Representation• Transparency, Accountability & ParticipationFounded in 2001 by Ramesh Ramanathan and Swati Ramanathan, Janaagraha started as a movement to enable citizen participation in public governance. It has now evolved into a robust institution for Citizenship and Democracy.",
