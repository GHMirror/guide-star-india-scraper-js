  "briefDescription": "Going to School makes beautiful, design-driven stories to inspire the poorest children and young people in India to stay in school to learn skills. We make storybooks that teach entrepreneurial skills, big mass-media appeal movies about hero entrepreneurs and we track our change in dynamic ways. Each week as children read one book they create a skills project in their community. We collect, grade and log their project - tracking every one of the 100,000 children in our program through their skill-learning journey.",
