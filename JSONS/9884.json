We are focusing our operations on these broad aspects in low-income schools across Pune. Access to technology Providing good-quality, relevant computer education Giving students a platform for experimentationWe believe that the potential of technology in education is underutilised particularly across low income schools and is limited to students being platform dependant or consumers of products ‘We feel our young people need to be able to shape technology as it shapes them and learn about technology through making with it'",
