  "briefDescription": "My Social Venture “Global Oral Health Foundation Society” is with a mission to provide for “Oral Healthcare for all”. The Cause of Undertaking Oral Health programmes for the poor and the underprivileged living in the rural countryside is to provide for an effective maintenance of good oral health and hygiene by way of subsidised treatment of dental ailments among the people irrespective of cultural or religious diversity. After all, we must not forget that 74% of India resides in its Villages.I had in this mission, conceptualized and set up the Dental Department at Shri Nabh Kanwal Raja Sahib Charitable Hospital at Village Mazara Nau-Abad in Nawanshahr-Punjab in the year 2007. This Dental Department went on to provide Dental Healthcare Treatment to the people living in the village and also to the surrounding villages at highly subsidized costs. It revolutionized Oral Healthcare among the rural areas in approximately around a belt of 150 Villages.",
