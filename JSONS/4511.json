  "briefDescription": "Sajjata Sangh is a network of Non Government Organisations engaged in natural resource management through a participatory process in different parts of Gujarat.  Currently, 33 NGOs working in different areas of Gujarat are associated as members with Sajjata Sangh.  The Sangh has done pioneering work on piloting and scaling up of rainfall insurance in the state. The radio programme “Sajjata no Sangh lave kheti ma rang” was run for five years and had about 5 lakh listeners across the state. It has led to creating awareness on improved agriculture practices, integrated pest management, integrated nutrient management etc. The network has also provided inputs in policy making forums on accreditation of NGOs both at the State and National levels.",
