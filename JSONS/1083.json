  "briefDescription": "The Samuel Foundation Charitable India Trust is the Indian chapter of the Germany based multi-national NGO Hedwig und Robert Samuel Stiftung working in Central America, Europe and Asia. It is legally registered in India as a Trust. In India it has been working since 1993. “Give Youth a Chance – Care and Education against Poverty” is the slogan which summarizes Foundation’s vision. Foundation is actively involved in poverty reduction by providing skill development among the underprivileged youth. The overriding target of the Foundation's work is to help people in need, not only quickly, but in a sustained manner. The target group of students is drawn from families of deprived backgrounds. The project is intended to increase our students’ sense of self-determination, self-sufficiency and autonomy. Through this, they are prepared by the Foundation to pursue their professional lives independently. In a study conducted by GTZ, the Foundation has been ranked among the top three organizations in India in terms of vocational training and job placements.",
