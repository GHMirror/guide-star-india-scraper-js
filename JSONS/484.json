  "briefDescription": "Sri Arunodayam is a home for abandoned intellectually challenged children in India. It was founded in 2002 as a registered public charitable trust and was recognized as a Reception Unit by the State Government of Tamil Nadu, in 2008.  Extreme poverty, social stigma and a lack of awareness and access to resources prompt parents to abandon their intellectually challenged children. These children are often abandoned in public places such as hospitals, bus and railway stations and even in dustbins! Child Welfare Committees, the Police and India's ChildLine services bring them to Sri Arunodayam where they are nurtured and rehabilitated. Sri Arunodayam assumes total responsibility for them and provides life-long care with nutritious food, accommodation, medical aid, special education, physiotherapy and vocational training.",
