  "briefDescription": "Yoganjali means to adopt ‘yoga’ in the totality of our life and help others to live.“I do not like to seek/ask for myself, only like to give to others.Those who want consolation, I will give them care/warmth. Those who seek to understand, I will give them knowledge.Those who seek affection, I will give them love.By giving I will gather, I will be filled only when I become empty.Ramila Gandhi, the spiritual fountain head of Yoganjali, sowed the seeds from this prayer into her mission and which broke the ground in 1974 and Yoganjali was born. Over the years, with single-minded dedication, determination and devotion from Ms. Ramila Gandhi, Yoganjali has now grown into a Kalpataru tree.",
