  "briefDescription": "Ether India believes that education should facilitate children to identify their capabilities, skills and set up their goals. Hence we focus on 3 Es: Education, Empowerment and Engagement. In the beginning we provide our support to 10 orphanages in Trivandrum. Ether India has conducted a study on the language proficiency among children in orphanages. We filled the questionnaire by 150 students and found that more than 90% of the children need support to learn, understand and speak English. And majority of them like to learn through different methods like games, acting, role plays, interactive etc.",
