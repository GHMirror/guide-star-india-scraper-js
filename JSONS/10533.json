  "briefDescription": "YouCanFreeUs India Trust is an international human rights organization that is fighting modern slavery around the world through advocacy, rescue, and rehabilitation. In India, we rescue women out of commercial sexual exploitation from the red-light districts of Maharashtra, provide them with psycho-social care and holistic healing, and help them re-enter society. We also help rehabilitate their children by providing them with shelter care facilities, education, and quality of life. So far, we have uplifted and rehabilitated over 75 women who have been involved in the red-light districts across Maharashtra.",
