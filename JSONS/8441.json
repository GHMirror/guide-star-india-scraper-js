  "briefDescription": "HAI is a newly established Indian organisation aspiring to work outside India, while also working in India on 1) humanitarian response, 2) disaster risk reduction, 3) climate change & adaptation, and 4) humanitarian advocacy. In India we are currently building up a platform, consisting of national NGOs, faith-based NGOs, corporate and media houses to respond to L2 and L* disasters with the objectives of; 1) reducing the response time to a disaster to save maximum lives, 2) reduce management cost so that maximum resources are utilised on programmes. The platform will work on other three thematic areas under a national programme to mitigate risk and vulnerability and strengthen resilience of most vulnerable communities across India.",
