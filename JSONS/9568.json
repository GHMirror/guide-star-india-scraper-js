  "briefDescription": "KHUSHII is an NGO headed by Mr Kapil Dev. We work in Remedial education. The reason why we chose this field is: The first ASER (Annual Status of Education Report) Survey in 2005 had reported that the proportion of Standard 4 children in India who could read a Standard 2 text was 47% only. The reason for low learning include non-availability of professionally trained teachers and adverse Pupil Teacher Ratios (PTR) at the school level which is as high as 41 and 54 in certain states. We have touched the lives of 20,000+  direct beneficiaries through our flagship program \"Swatantra Shikshaantra\" which addresses poor infrastructure, low Pupil-Teacher ratio,low learning levels and greater drop outs by emphasizing on STEM & Digital Learning.",
