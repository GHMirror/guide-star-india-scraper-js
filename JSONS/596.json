  "briefDescription": "Centre for Advocacy and Research works on the issues of the most marginalised, vulnerable and “voiceless” sections of the society. It uses a rights based framework to challenge the unequal power relations and the status quo that exist, advocate for addressing structural and systemic barriers that propel exclusion and marginalisation and do this by creating spaces for policy and programme review and reform from a community-centred perspective. Over close to a decade CFAR has been perpetually engaging with poor communities across varied geographies on similar concerns of health, HIV prevention, sanitation, nutrition, gender equality and  curbing gender based violence from curbing sex determination to preventing and addressing domestic violence to early marriage and sexual crimes.  Our approach is essentially community-centric as we forge strong partnerships with them, enable them to collectivize, capacitate them to participate fully in governance structures ; links them up with ministries and departments, also with civil society networks and media to ensure that their authorship gets affirmed and their contribution is kept at the centre of all processes aimed at change.
