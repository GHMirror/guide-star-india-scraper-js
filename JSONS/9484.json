  "briefDescription": "SETUs emerged as cluster level information centres immediately post the 2001 earthquake to play a bridge role in coordinating effective relief and information needs. Down the line, SETUs curved its own niche â€“ facilitating local people & external agencies towards strengthening communities to decide, negotiate and monitor for the kind & the pace of development that they need and can sustain. Since 2004, SETUs thus focused on strengthening local governance more prominently through various innovations. SETUs became registered under Trust and Society in Mar 2014 under the name SETU Abhiyan.SETU Abhiyan focuses on accompanying local governments (Gram Panchayats and Urban Local Bodies) in efficient functioning on principles of improved local governance. As a core strategy to this, the Learning Lab for Local Governance is an initiative of SETU Abhiyan which promotes knowledge sharing, research/ studies on local governance and thus contributes to the local governance discourse.",
