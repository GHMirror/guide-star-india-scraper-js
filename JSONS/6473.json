  "briefDescription": "Stop Acid Attacks (SAA) is a campaign against acid violence. A survivor of an acid attack requires immediate medical, financial and psychological support on human grounds. But, the judicial procedures in this country do not assure any such intervention or help to the survivor until a court announces so. It is this loophole in the procedure of justice that we work on by generating immediate medical and final support for the victims and providing them and their families the needed psychological and legal support.",
