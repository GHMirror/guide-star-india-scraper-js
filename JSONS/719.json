  "briefDescription": "The long forgotten sections of the society rise to claim their Equal Rights and equal participation due to Human dignity under as one AKSHAYA – disables people’s Human Rights organization (DPO). In 1998, the group of Disables’ felt that Disables Rights based issue and Disability Development   programs could be addressed more effectively only through an Institutional Mechanism. Because, in Tamil Nadu state, majority of the DPO’s, CSOs, CBO’s, NGO’s, are charity oriented rather than Rights mode. So, we have started “AKSHAYA” as a disables people’s Human Rights organization (DPO) legally registered under Indian Trust Act with the group of disables in the same year to work for the disables empowerment. Since then “AKSHAYA” has been undertaking many initiatives fulfilling the demands of its constituency. This forms the basis for “AKSHAYA Rehabilitation Trust” in 1998 to address the rights issues of disabled persons in a comprehensive manner. For the past 12 years we are serving for to ensure equal rights and holistic development of disables' in the Tamil Nadu. AKSHAYA emerge as the Disability social movement DPO in the early 1998 in the Tamil Nadu State of INDIA, holding the state accountable for Rights and Development of the PWDs in the most discriminated and deprived section of the society.",
