  "briefDescription": "The organisation mobilises the Bhil Tribal people locally and at the provincial, national and international levels to get access to and control over natural resources and also cooperate to conserve these resources, improve the quality of their agriculture and enhance their livelihood opportunities.  The whole hearted participation of women in these efforts doubles the social energy involved in them by reducing patriarchal oppression and helps in the evolution of a liberating framework of action and conservation that is both equitable and sustainable. The organisation also works among Dalits and Tribals in the city of Indore. The direct impact of the work is on 30,000 people and the indirect impact is on 2 million.",
