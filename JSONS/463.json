  "briefDescription": "Sense International India, is an NGO that supports and advocates for better services for deafblind people in India. Sense International India aims to create a world where children and adults with deafblindness can be full and active members of the society. Also known as Sense India, our vision and commitment to the cause of deafblindness makes us stand apart from other NGOs in India. Sense India was established in 1997 when there was only one school catering to the needs of deafblind children. Today, it has grown into a massive network of 59 partner NGOs spread across 22 states in India. Sense India is striving to change the definition of \"Disability\" to \"Differently-abled\" by providing education to deafblind children, vocational training and livelihood support to deafblind adults, training for families and professionals and help other NGOs to work with deafblind children and adults. Please join hands with us at Sense International India (http://senseintindia.org/) to support deafblind people to become contributing members to society. If you are an individual, you can donate financially, or support as a volunteer. If you are a corporate entity, you can enable payroll giving on a regular basis or you can also sponsor events and successfully reach your target customers through cause related marketing.",
