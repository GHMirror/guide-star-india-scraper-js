  "briefDescription": "The Mother Teresa Memorial Social Welfare Trust was established in 2001 at a time when Dharavi in Mumbai faced an acute dearth of educational facilities for the grow- ing number of children. The government hardly paid any attention to the  needs  of  the local people and only two poorly managed senior secondary schools and a few primary schools are in operation under the government set ups, which have unsatisfactory standards. But the Trust strives on, and slowly but surely under the able leadership of Mr Anthony Rajan there is a sense of hope in the otherwise area of darkness. Your help is needed to keep their smiles alive.",
