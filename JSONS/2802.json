  "briefDescription": "A special Intervention programme was launched in Orissa in July, 2010. The aim of this programme was to help these children overcome their difficulties and bring them in to the mainstream by improving their educational, health facilities. We have started supporting school going as well as irregular school going children in addition to our normal programme for the children with the objective of reducing the drop out rate due to poverty. We contacted some schools through our staff and identified the needy girl child. We provided educational kits (Scale, Pencil, Crayon, Drawing copy, sharpener, Eraser, Pen, Geometry Box, Pencil Box, Books, Guide Books, Test Papers, Note books, School Bag including copies for handwriting in Oriya as well as in English.
