  "briefDescription": "The need, basically, is to come forward and do something while we are capable of doing something for somebody. Selflessly.Children are the future. We, at AASHRAIY, believe that differently-abled children and youngsters need to be nourished if we need them to become responsible adults. Through the concept of “Parents Helping Parents”, we do not seek only an outward development of children. We  try to make an inward change, right from the root; the family.\"We think that it takes a lot to do a noble work. Frankly, it only takes the intention. You need to only begin caring and the ways to help will find your intentions.\"",
