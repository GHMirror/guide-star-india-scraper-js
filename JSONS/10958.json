The region consists of 8 districts which are not only drought prone but also atrocity prone areas. Feudalism has still forces socio-economic life of people. Secondary status of women is not only leading to violence against women but also this region become infamous for sex selective abortions. High population of landless and unskilled labours, dalit atrocities, violence against women, negligence to child rights, lack of proper educational opportunities and guidance to children as well as youths, high unemployment rate, drug addiction become the features of the region. Society is trapped",
