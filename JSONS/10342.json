  "briefDescription": "Happy Home is filled with vibrant joyful, loveable little flowers waiting to bloom and transform their small garden into a peaceful paradise for them and many others like them. They all need the emotional encouragement that comes from knowing someone cares.Happy Home took shape in the year 2008 as a home for orphans, with just five abandoned street children. We gained recognition with a registration in 2009, and with 14 budding girls and five young underprivileged boys .Happy Home has since that time proudly blossomed into a beautiful bouquet of thirty four well behaved humble young children. Slowly but steadily they have become a strong family, step by step.",
