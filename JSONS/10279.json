  "briefDescription": "One of our efforts is to make independent to each and every section of Indian citizens who are struggling with life for their and their children’s livelihood. Deteriorating living standards in the rural sector as well as the miserable condition of women is also a matter of concern for us. We want to make an effort to make all these people aware about modern Education, technology, health and sanitation and motivate them to live a life full of self–respect.",
