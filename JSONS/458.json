SATHI rescues children from railway platforms, offers them protection at shelters, provides counselling & psychological support and attempts to reunite the child with the family, provided there is a caring and conducive environment for the child’s holistic growth.

Over the past 24 years, SATHI has reunited more than 60,000 children back with their families.SATHI also engages with Govt.
