  "briefDescription": "Butterflies is a registered voluntary organisation working with the most vulnerable groups of children, especially street and working children since 1989. With a rights based, non-institutional approach the organisation endeavours to educate and impart life skills to vulnerable children so that they become self-reliant and exit out of the cycle of generational illiteracy & poverty. Over the years Butterflies has initiated a number of innovative interventions in the field and partnered with the government and non-government agencies to garner support for children.",
