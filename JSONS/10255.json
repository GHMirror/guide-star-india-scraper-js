  "briefDescription": "Let’s Live Together (LLT), founded by Dr.Vijayakumari and Achala Paani in 2009, is an organization fiercely dedicated to saving homeless animals. Although LLT was incorporated in 2009, Ms. Paani has helped to find homes for more than 1600 homeless animals (dogs and cats) in Bangalore, India since the year 2000. Over the years, Ms. Paani has single-handily grown the program to become a public outreach program that must secure additional public and private support to expand and save more animals.Let’s Live Together is the only animal protection organization in Bangalore, working souly to promote adoption of “Indi” dogs through foster homes and  has led the way by offering its out of the box alternative to Traditional shelters with high welfare standards.",
