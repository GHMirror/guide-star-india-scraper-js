  "briefDescription": "Grama Pengal Munnetra Sangam (GPMS) is a women development, women constituted and women headed non-governmental organization. Mrs. Mayandi Pasumpon hailing from a poor family in ‘Kokkulam village’ stood as the key person for the emergence of GPMS.  She initiated various activities such as gem-cutting, tailoring, housing for 100 families, distributed special nutritious food to malnourished children,  organized women self help groups in 300 villages, distribution of free saplings, literacy programmes, awareness training programmes, women’s rights, property disputes etc. GPMS strongly believes that the western concepts of development could be simplified and made understandable so as apply them locally for getting good results.",
