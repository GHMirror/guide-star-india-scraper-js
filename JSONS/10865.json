  "briefDescription": "Mission & Vision:-We dream of a society where the health, education and nutrition of every child is secured and the strictly personal problems of women, instead of being treated trivial, are subjected to scientific knowledge and analysis. We wish that every adolescent boy and girl shines in terms of his/her mental, physical growth and moral character. We envisage a society where poverty, hunger, ignorance are replaced by knowledge, self-employment, food and nutrition lighting a smile on every face.Achievement: From March,2018 till now we have organized 15 menstrual hygiene awareness camps in various schools and rural areas in Nagaon district and have achieved the goal of making 2000+ women and adolescent girls aware.",
