  "briefDescription": "Indian Community Welfare Organisation a registered voluntary organisation was established in 1994. It was born out of deep and abiding concern for marginalized and exploited women in difficult circumstances in India.  The focus was on working with high-risk population and their clients and certain other target groups with the ultimate aim of empowering them. ICWO is doing a considerable amount of work in the field of STI/HIV/AIDS prevention with the aid of several dedicated volunteers, the constant encouragement and support of the government. Yet there are several mountains to climb.",
