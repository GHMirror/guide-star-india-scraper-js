Since our inception in 2011, we have transformed lives of 7100 children in 7 states. We have 342 children enrolled in higher education and 18 are employed. Our mission is to bring life-changing care to orphaned and vulnerable children. We partner with community-based organisations to strengthen families and communities, reunite children with parents or relatives, advocate adoptive families for abandoned children, and strengthen Children's Homes in rural and semi-urban areas by improving their quality of care.Until all children are in a loving family, we will continue to make sure they thrive wherever they are.",
