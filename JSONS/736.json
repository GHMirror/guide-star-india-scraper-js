  "briefDescription": "The objective of Shoshit Seva Sangh (SSS) is to provide quality education to the poorest of the poor, the children of the \"musahar\" (rat-eater) community in Bihar, who have lived in abysmal poverty for centuries. The musahar population is estimated to be 4 to 5 million, and all of them are landless labourers - with many being bonded labourers. The vast majority are caught in a debt-trap finding it impossible to break out of the vicious cycle of poverty.SSS has established Shoshit Samadhan Kendra (SSK), a charitable English-medium residential school which seeks to empower its students with the education, skills and character required to maximise their potential and transform lives. The school provides free tuition, boarding, lodging, clothing, healthcare and other necessities. SSS also helps its alumni to get admitted to institutions of higher education, and pays for their tuition, boarding as well as lodging at such institutions.Our students are becoming catalysts of change in their community. We are in this for the long haul, and the project's impact will be permanent - resulting in a silent revolution.",
