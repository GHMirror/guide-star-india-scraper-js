  "briefDescription": "I Create, Inc (a non-profit 501 ( C ) (3) corporation) was established in 1999 to train youth and women in entrepreneurship so that they can have an option to start their own small business instead of looking for jobs, which are not there for so many. The program is reaching thousands of disadvantaged members of society. These include women (different sub-groups like widows, destitute, unmarried), unemployed youth and students from high schools, vocational institutes & colleges, tribal members and rural communities.  I Create, registered in the USA, chose India as its initial geographic area of operation. www.icreateincorporated.org I Create India is the National Body in India.
