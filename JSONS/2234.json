  "briefDescription": "At SHE, an organization named after more than 300 crore women who constitute half the population of the world, we believe that poverty can be eradicated and any hope of earthâ€™s survival cherished, only if women lead equal, healthy, violence free, independent lives.The main thematic issues selected reflect our deep understanding that in order to achieve gender equality, both de facto and de jure it is necessary to build a society in which women and men share equally in the distribution of power and influence and have equal access to education, health, decent work and livelihoods.We are people-centric, have a planned approach to developmental activities with a specific focus on Gender Inequality and the welfare and rights of the vulnerable women and children to  stop exploitation including prevention of child marriage.",
