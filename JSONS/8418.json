  "briefDescription": "Avanti’s Learning Centers provide low-income high-school students a world-class science and mathematics education. Our centers have no trained teachers and very little conventional lecturing. In their place, we focus on teaching students how to learn from books and their peers – resources that are more abundant, accessible and consistent in quality. Over the past year, we’ve shown that our students perform at par with some of the most expensive after-school programs in the country. Last year over 6,000 students took our entrance exam for 150 spots. This year, we will test over 10,000 students to fill 300 spots in our program.",
