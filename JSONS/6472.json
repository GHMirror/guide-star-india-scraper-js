  "briefDescription": "Pratyaya EduResearch Lab is a not-for-profit organization incorporated under Section 25 of the Companies Act, 1956 in January 2014 with a mission to build a self-sustainable educational ecosystem at village level that promotes research in school education. This would transform the conventional pedagogy; being followed at school, into a PBL (Project-Based-Learning)  pedagogy - where students will get an opportunity to implement their learning into real action through Hands-on and experimental approach. The environment so created would give an equal opportunity to all the students irrespective of any discrimination and thus empowering our rural communities both socially and economically.",
