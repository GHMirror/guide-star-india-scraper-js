  "briefDescription": "We, a group of professionals , are working on some fields of social work since 1994, like Health related programmes, Plantation of trees, Animal Welfare, Women Empowerment, Road Safety, and Welfare of Street Children etc. The expenditure on these programmes, were borne by this group, and if needed, collections were made from other friends also. Till 1997 no formal and organizational shape was given to this informal organization. We were simply fond of doing some thing for the needy and weaker section of society, what we thought better at that time. In June 1997, we formed the NGO and got it registered with the Registrar of Societies, Punjab, under Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860.",
