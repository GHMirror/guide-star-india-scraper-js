  "briefDescription": "Ragging (in educational institutions) has ruined countless young lives, careers, dreams, and families. About 12 years ago, a group of unrelated youths (professionals and students), who came together at online platforms, joined hands to establish a Non-Profit organization dedicated to addressing this issue.Since then,  the organization has been working to defend the rights and the dignity of such young students across the country. Today the Society Against Violence in Education (SAVE) works on following key areas-Victim Support & Empowerment, Awareness, Advocacy, Providing technical guidance to institutions, Checking compliance of institutions.SAVE has featured in numerous news reports nationally as well as internationally. It has featured in a popular TV show like \"Satyamev Jayate\"(Season III, EP.6) hosted by Mr. Aamir Khan.",
