  "briefDescription": "LeapForWord is a product NGO committed to eliminating the single biggest bottleneck - Poor English Capabilities - that prohibits students from regional language communities from accessing Professional Education & better Employment Opportunities. Our flagship solution - The English Literacy Program - is designed for teachers who have a job of teaching English but cannot do so effectively because they cannot speak English. Built on top of a Translation Algorithm, the solution enables such teachers to teach English in their mother-tongue and develop specific capabilities in their students namely Reading, Comprehension & Sentence Structuring.  Since inception, we have reached out to more than 40,000 students through 3,500+ teachers",
