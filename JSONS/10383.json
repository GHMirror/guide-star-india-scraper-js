  "briefDescription": "Akshaya Aahara Foundation Â®  is a non-govt. and a not-for-profit organization started with an objective to provide food to the needy and poor people of the society.Our aim is to collect surplus/excess, prepared food, from donors like Marriage Halls, Gatherings, Hotels, School/College Canteens, Parties,  etc and distribute it to needy/hungry people, Govt. Hospitals, slums, etc in our Food Vans.Surplus food received by us is free.  But the cost of collection of the surplus food and transporting the same in our Mini Food Vans to the various places like Govt. Hospitals, Poor colonies, orphanages, and slums around Mysore, is quite high.  We earnestly request you to give monetary donations for this worthy cause to enable us to sustain this activity.",
