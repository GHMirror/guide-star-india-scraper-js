  "briefDescription": "Every community based organization is germinated to address to a specific social need. Like others, the genesis of “AIM” Art Illuminates Mankind is no exception. A group of like-minded social activists, with their vision to a sustainable social development, joined hands together for meaningful social interventions to protect the rights and to safeguard the interests of the poor and underprivileged sections of the society. In order to fulfill that vision, the organization viz. “AIM” Art Illuminates Mankind was established in 2003 with its mission to focus, study and research on the folk culture, tribal art and craft along with the associated people to bring those people into limelight through various required social interventions .",
