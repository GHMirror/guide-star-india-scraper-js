  "briefDescription": "‘Samavedana‘ means to understand ones’ pain and act towards easing it. Samavedana’s various programmes have derived and developed with time depending on the need identified in the society. We work in Treatment, Prevention & Awareness as Samavedana’s core arms to meet needs of the deprived. Samavedana has successfully attempted to involve medical fraternity and society at large to help the needy ones. Samavedana pools contributions from the society, doctors waive off their fees and hospitals offer services at discounted rates for our beneficiary patients. We design our modules and programmes to help underprivileged ones. The programmes at Samavedana aim to help based on need and irrespective of the creed.",
