  "briefDescription": "The East West Foundation of India (TEWFI) has operated for over 20 years across 24 villages in Tamil Nadu. We have established a Children's Home for abandoned, destitute and orphaned children, currently giving refuge to 46 children. We provide healthcare through a clinic and a mobile ambulance clinic for remote villages. Our education programs are both modern and innovative with an English Medium Nursery and Primary School, as well as e-Classroom on Wheels Project that gives computer and IT training in rural/remote schools. Our Community Development programs also benefit thousands every year. Finally, rejuvenation of the costal land, water waste management, and water catchment ponds are key in our environmental sustainability programs.",
