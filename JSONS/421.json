Paripurnata strives to bring about a change in their existence to a socially meaningful and productive life with dignity. Since its inceptions in 1992, Paripurnata has rehabilitated 228 women with their families and society at large. They are from almost all the provinces of India and also from Nepal and Bangladesh",
