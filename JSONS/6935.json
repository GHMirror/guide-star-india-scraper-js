  "briefDescription": "India will continue to add 1 million to its workforce every month for the next 15 years, most of whom come from impoverished backgrounds. Our growing economy with a massive skill-deficit provides real opportunity for them to escape the cycle of poverty, through gainful employment but imparting livelihood training is proving to be insufficient.The/Nudge Foundation focuses on sustainable poverty alleviation by building a strong 360-degree life, learning and economic foundation for underprivileged youth in residential “Gurukuls”, along with lifelong support system. The/Nudge Foundation is a collective initiative of some of India’s best leaders and entrepreneurs, with a dream to see a poverty-free India within our generation.",
