  "briefDescription": "The Urban Design Research Institute (UDRI) was created in 1984 by a group of concerned citizens who served as its founding trustees: Mr Ratan Tata, Mr Nani Palkhiwala, Mr Nana Chudasama, Mr Charles Correa, Mr Wadud Khan and Mr Keshub Mahindra.Our mandate is to make Greater Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan area an inclusive region which is humane, and balances its cosmopolitan cultural heritage and social fabric with equitable growth and efficient infrastructure. A city where living, working and mobility are less stressful and more enjoyable, with easily accessible amenities and public spaces for all. In this respect, urban planning and policy, urban design and heritage conservation are the core concerns of UDRI.",
