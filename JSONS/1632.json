  "briefDescription": "We are, educo, an NGO located in Central Mumbai managing a school in partnership with the MCGM. Our curriculum is focused on providing high quality English medium education to our students. However, we lay equal emphasis on imparting structured value education in order to build the studentâ€™s character. With active parent engagement and commitment to educo, we are able to impact the local community thereby being catalysts for social change.Parel (Lalbaug) grapples with poverty and under-development, amidst the development and boomtown high rises surrounding it. This area is among the least literate communities in Mumbai. Education of the children and engagement with their parents will help this disenfranchised group of people into mainstream occupations.Educo provides greater visibility for corporates & CSR projects. Further, employee engagement programs can be more impactful, credible and logistically easy to implement as educo is at a viable location.We hope you will be the eventual employers of our future model citizens.We request you to visit the schools and experience the passion on ground.",
