  "briefDescription": "Founded in 1996 by Ms. Chetna Sinha, Mann Deshi Foundation envisions to empower women to make their own choices and to be celebrated as equal and valuable members of their families and communities. We, along with Mann Deshi Bank, aim to provide comprehensive business support to rural women entrepreneurs. Mann Deshi Foundation runs Business School for Rural Women to train them in relevant business skills through the centers as well as at beneficiaries’ doorsteps. We also run a chamber of commerce to facilitate networking and capacity building among the members. Along with the women’s empowerment programmes, we run community empowerment initiatives such as water conservation, sports for rural kids, marketing linkages for farmers, bicycles for girls and community radio station. Headquartered in Mhaswad, we are currently operational in the states of Maharashtra, Gujrat and Karnataka reaching more than 400 thousand beneficiaries. We aim to reach 1 milion individuals by 2022.",
