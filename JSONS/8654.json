  "briefDescription": "In   the  year  2005  a  group  of  people  formed  a  charitable   trust  in the  name  and   style  ‘Nesakarankal’  and  started   a  special   school  for  mentally  retarded   children.  As they  could not  get  a  place  to run  the school  they  approached  Arul  chandru  nilayam   at  Paramakudi ,   a  human  resource  development   centre   of  the  Brothers  of  the  sacred    heart.     realizing     their   need  we  accommodated   the  School   in  the  premises  with   7 children. As  we had  regular  programs    and  the  number  enrolment  in the  school  increased   we  could  not  provide  them the  required   space.",
