  "briefDescription": "The primary objective of ASHWINI is to establish a health system that is accessible, acceptable, effective and sustainable. It should be owned and managed by the people themselves. The most important aspect of this health intervention is the strong emphasis on involving the adivasi community and in training adivasi youth to deliver the services. We believe that communities can be empowered by a participatory development process of capacity building and decentralization that culminates in community owned and managed programs and institutions. Ownership of institutions that cater to the mainstream population is a powerful tool in bringing about a change in social equations.20000 tribals, majority of who live below the poverty line, are the beneficiaries of the project.",
