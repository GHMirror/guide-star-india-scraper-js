  "briefDescription": "EarthCare Designs Foundation is a Nasik-based organisation. We envision EarthCare Designs as a socio-cultural, spiritual, and technologically innovative space. We design products and technology that is viable for individuals, empowering for communities, and regenerative for the environment. These designs conserve energy resources, build upon the wisdom of earth-based communities, & ensure healthy livelihoods. We prioritize human-scale efforts, which operate on free and abundant natural resources like solar and muscle energy as well as human creativity. At the heart of this enterprise is the development of leadership that will guide India's marginalised communities towards unity, justice and a reconnection between people & the natural world.",
