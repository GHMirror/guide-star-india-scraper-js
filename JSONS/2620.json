  "briefDescription": "PAHAL is a national level non-profit making voluntary organization working for the welfare of underprivileged children and women in the field of Education, Healthcare and Livelihood. Most of the areas where we are working have acute poverty, lack of basic facilities, rampant unemployment where probably the only silver lining is the host of beautiful mountains!Despite India’s spectacular economic development, millions still have to go hungry; live in most unhygienic conditions, without even basic education for their children; and die of diseases that can be prevented. What is needed is to build a strong civil society that should work in tandem with the government in making a difference in the lives of those who are in need.Thematic Areas    Education    Health    Livelihood    Women Empowerment    Special InterventionsGood GovernanceGovernance is the need of the hour in the development sector in order to ensure and promote application of best management practices, compliance of law and adherence to best possible ethical standards. The entire management processes and practices of PAHAL are in compliance with the principles of ‘Good Governance’.We have a proper ‘audit and evaluation mechanism’ to ensure the impact of the investment and accountability in utilisation of funds.",
