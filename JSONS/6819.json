  "briefDescription": "YFA as on organization, was inspired by the selfless work of Baba Amte. During his National Tour with Youths in connection with the \"Bharat Jodo\" or \"Knit India\" movement, he showed overwhelming concern for the poor particularly women, children, degrading eco-system and its impact on health, income and livelihood patterns in the villages. In a series of sharing sessions with group of young men, he first mooted the idea of an organized team to put in efforts at the grassroots level searching for sustainable solutions to the problems. Thus YFA came into existence formally in the year 1986 initially consisting of Vadere Ramachandra Reddy, the first donor of land for the Bhoodhan movement VinobhaBhave,Sri.KanakaiahSashtry & Sri.E.VenkatRamnayya",
