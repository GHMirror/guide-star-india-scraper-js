  "briefDescription": "Hope Kolkata Foundation was set up in 1999 to improve the lives of children living in illiteracy and deprivation. Our work for the past 13 years has been a heaven for children who are forced to leave home due to poverty or abandoned by their families every year. HKF has endeavored to make an impact, working with over 20000 children directly and 2,00,000 people in 24 wards indirectly, and in further 30 wards through Child Watch, night round programs from the vulnerable and weaker sections of society, in the sectors of Protection, Education, Health and Skill Enhancement. This has made a difference for these children who would have otherwise been rag-pickers or child laborers. Many of those children have moved beyond- empowered and enthusiastic in their response to a world of opportunities.We also strive to coalesce with other stakeholders, to consistently build relationships with individuals and organizations working closely with children. In raising awareness about the hardships faced by street children in Kolkata, HKF wishes to affirm the sanctity of each child. Our main purpose is to create an atmosphere which respects and recognizes the rights of the child and combats their violation.",
