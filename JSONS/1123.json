  "briefDescription": "Mayiladumparai Block is situated at the Foot-hills of Western Ghat Hills in Theni District, a remote corner of the District in Tamil Nadu. This block is declared as industrially backward since Industries are completely absent. Agriculture is the main occupation. Farmers are depending upon North - east monsoon for their farming activities. But agriculture is not a thriving profession, since monsoon fails regularly in this area and the farmers are not using improved methods of agriculture. Majority of the population are agriculture laborers getting job opportunities only in the season and in off-season they are jobless, becoming poorer and poorer, indebted to the local moneylenders, struggling for their daily bread. Under this circumstance, they are helpless, find it very difficult to run their family and their living condition is precarious and miserable. So, some of them migrated to the nearby plantations in Western Ghat Hills or to the cities like Chennai, Bangalore, Tiruppur in search of employment opportunities. Considering the pathetic situation of these poor unfortunate people, Mr. Venkatesan in cooperation with some of the like-minded social workers had established Literate Welfare Association to work for the welfare of these people.",
