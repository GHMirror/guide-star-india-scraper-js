  "briefDescription": "Digital Green is a global development organization that empowers smallholder farmers to lift themselves out of poverty by harnessing the collective power of technology and grassroots-level partnerships.We partner with local public, private and civil society organisations to share knowledge on improved agricultural practices, livelihoods, health, and nutrition, using locally produced videos disseminated using hand-held battery-operated projectors by local extension agents. The approach is found to be more cost-effective and uptake of new practices by viewers is higher compared to traditional extension services. We have reached over 1.5 million people through our work across Asia & sub-Saharan Africa. We're supported by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, DFID, Google, and Government of India.",
