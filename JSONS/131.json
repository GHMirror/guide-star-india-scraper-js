  "briefDescription": "The Akshaya Patra Foundation is a registered trust working nationwide in India to end hunger of underserved children and facilitate their education. In partnership with the central and state governments of India, the Akshaya Patra Foundation serves the largest number of hot, freshly-cooked school meals in the country six days of the week. Reaching out to over 1.4 million children in 24 locations across 10 states of India, Akshaya Patra is now the world’s largest NGO-run school meal program. A strong incentive to parents to send children to school, thereby encouraging enrolment, reducing absenteeism and dropout rates, the programme has a positive impact on health and nutrition of children. With the vision “ no child should be deprived of education because of hunger”, the foundation aims to reach out to 5 million children by 2020",
