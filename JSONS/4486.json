  "briefDescription": "Isha Vidhya rural schools have been started in villages (under the umbrella of Isha Education trust, established in 2005) to provide high-quality school education to underprivileged rural children who cannot otherwise access or afford it.  The holistic, activity-based approach nurtures childrenâ€™s development beyond just academics, ensuring that students realise their full potential and learn in a joyful manner.> There are 9 Isha Vidhya rural schools with 8000 students, many first-generation learners from economically backwards families. 8 of these are in Tamil Nadu and 1 is in Andhra Pradesh.> About 61% of these children are supported by full scholarships while the remaining pay a nominal fee. The scholarships cover tuition, notebooks and textbooks. A highly subsidised noon-meal is also provided.> 32 Govt. schools in 4 districts of TN have also been adopted where critical interventions like hiring extra teachers, English language teaching and teacher training impact over 10000 students through enhanced quality of education in these schools.> Interventions carried out in 3000 Govt. Schools in AP in partnership with Govt., impacting over 120,000 students and 10,500 teachers",
