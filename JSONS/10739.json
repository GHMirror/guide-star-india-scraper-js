  "briefDescription": "Thrive Foundation aims to address the lack of availability of positive, preventive and protective mental health services in low-income schools. Through in-class sessions on social and emotional skills for students, teacher and parent training workshops and policy-making at a whole-school level, we seek to build psychological resilience in every child to negotiate the multiple risk factors they face in their impoverished neighbourhoods every day.",
