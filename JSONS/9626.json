  "briefDescription": "Since 1994, CBM India trust has been promoting access to quality health care, education and livelihood for people with disabilities and those at risk of disability.  We work across 26 states of India and reach some of the most marginalized social groups. We believe in community based disability inclusive development with a rights based approach based on the united national convention on rights for persons with disabilities and the sustainable development goals (SDGs) 2030. Participation of people with disabilities, their families and community, is a non-negotiable principle for us. An inclusive world is only possible with partnerships that create equal opportunities and a barrier free environment. Drawing from our tagline ‘together we can do more’, we bring together civil society organizations, experts, government officials, companies and international agencies.",
