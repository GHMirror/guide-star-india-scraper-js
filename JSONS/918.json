  "briefDescription": "Dasra is India's leading strategic philanthropy foundation working withphilanthropists and social entrepreneurs to create large scale social change. Over the past 12 years, Dasra has been successful in researching, evaluating and scaling over 200 non profits and social businesses. We have enabled over INR 55 crores of funding to these organizations. Throughout this period, Dasra has been refining its “investment model” to be similar to a private equity fund whereby we undertake sector research to identify gaps, perform rigorous due diligence on organizations and their management teams, and then disburse grants which institute both quantitative and qualitative metrics over a 3-5 year period. Post grant disbursement, Dasra spends intensive time working closely with non profit management teams to help them improve programs, expand outreach and become sector leaders. Through this approach, Dasra has enabled organizations to increase their breadth (more beneficiaries), depth (better service) and sustainability (financial and organizational).",
