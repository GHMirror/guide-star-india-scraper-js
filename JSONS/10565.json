  "briefDescription": "Students are the future of the Nation, guiding them in the right direction means creating a better future. ARWEL found that there is a lack of innovative and creative teachers who could present the school subjects in a way that the students could learn and understand easily. Students from 6th â€“ 9th std. were taken up as the primary beneficiaries focusing on subject based learning (English, Maths and Science). Govt. schools in terms of academics were chosen to enhance teaching using various innovative methods and address the gaps / inequalities in the education to an extent. Currently ARWEL serving 55 Govt. schools with the target beneficiaries approximately 27500+. ARWEL with the vision of supporting 100,000 in the year 2020.",
