  "briefDescription": "Our mission is to spread public awareness of India’s rich & varied folk & tribal culture, starting with West Bengal, mainly through a  structured, content-rich, dynamic, web portal that is a single window dedicated to such arts. We also  wish to help create sustainable & dignified means of livelihood for such artists through activities that promote their arts.Our small organization, which started in April 2013, has focussed on researching & documenting, in particular, lesser known rural arts & artists. Our web portal which was launched in Feb 2014, is an online folk encyclopedia of sorts, with multimedia illustrations wherever possible –addressing all forms of folk & tribal art – performing, visual, crafts etc. It features to-date 42 different art forms. We showcase an artist each month & connect artists with buyers/organizers through our portal.  This year, we have started organizing workshops at the grassroot level & have also showcased rural arts in Kolkata.",
