  "briefDescription": "We carry the Notebooks (laptops), all electrical extension boards LCD projector and the Screen in a vehicle to the school and set up the class. It takes about one hour to set up the class. Students are divided into batches. Every week each school is visited twice. Children are allocated a notebook each so that all their work is saved on a particular machine. Each class is manned by one trainer, one assistant trainer, an admin assistant and preferably a couple of volunteers to help the children. In addition to this every school has a Site manager (an experienced person) to oversee the entire operations. Apart from the Site Manager all are paid resources. Current no beneficiaries 1200",
