  "briefDescription": "Point of View is located in Mumbai, Maharashtra.In a democracy, all citizens should have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives: men, women and trans people.‘Having a voice’ equals being heard, being considered, being counted, being part of, being able to influence. Being. Being human. Many women’s voices still remain silent, silenced, marginal, unheard, discounted, or illegitimate. Many women’s lips still remain zipped, their lives and realities unspoken. Our work challenges and changes this.",
