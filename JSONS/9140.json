  "briefDescription": "Women's Synergy is a non-profit Trust registered in Delhi and operational in Delhi-NCR & Bengaluru (Karnataka) for empowering women through Synergies and Symbiotic relationships among women from an eclectic mix of backgrounds, with particular focus on 'circumstantially' (physically, psychologically, financially, socially) challenged women. Our vision is to create an eco-system for Indian women in the form of a Resource pool created by women’s own efforts and with the backing of ‘WS’ that would serve as a fall back at ready reach for them, including their less advantaged counterparts, in their times of utmost need!Our programs, activities and all that we do are hinged around emotional wellness of women, with their holistic states of well-being in mind.  Due emphasis is given to the need for women to articulate their problems, take self-initiatives for growth and development and be proactive partners in their own progress.  Our programs are not interventional in nature and are not restricted to any particular geographic focus as we believe that if that were so, any and all women falling out such identified zones would be deprived of support, lest they should be seekers - especially those, proactive ones seeking solutions for themselves.  We now have our presence in Delhi-NCR and Bengaluru as well.",
