  "briefDescription": "Elixir Foundation is an initiative by the Presidential Awardees of Government of India i.e IG NSS Awardees and National Youth Awardees to ubiquitously enhance lives for a better society. Today, our society is suffering from a plethora of negative influences that are dragging our nation's progress. Poverty, Unemployment, Over-Population, illiteracy etc. are the major ones. There are efforts being done in the areas to curb the above mentioned concerns but more initiatives need to be taken especially by the youth of the country. Elixir is a step to ubiquitously, in every area do small & big deeds & deal with the concerns in our own smaller ways to improve the state of the world.",
