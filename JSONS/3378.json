  "briefDescription": "Udaan India Foundation (Udaan) is a Mumbai based not-for-profit organization working with children from low-income communities in the field of education. Our primary aim is to ensure that every child of school going age is gaining a strong and holistic educational foundation to become a responsible, compassionate and confident citizen of tomorrow. Most Udaan children are from families where there has been little or no formal education, where education is not a priority and it is a common place for children to drop out of school in order to contribute to the family income. Believing in the power of education to change lives, a childâ€™s journey at Udaan starts at the Kindergarten level, continues through school years and supports them until they become employable. The focus is always in making learning a continuous, joyous and voluntary experience that will help the children discover and achieve their true potential and take on the future with confidence.",
