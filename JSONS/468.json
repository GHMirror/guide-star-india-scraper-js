  "briefDescription": "Unemployment – it is believed - is one of the most pressing issues of our time. However, recent studies suggest that the problem is not so much one of unemployment, but of “un-employability.” While both, youth and jobs are available in great numbers, there exists a yawning gap between the requirements for a job and the qualifications of the youth. This is where Unnati comes in. Unnati offers vocational training for youth, with guaranteed job placements. Unnati offers a 50 day programme in which all students – in addition to a vocation - are taught Spoken English, Basic Computers, Lifeskills and Values. This holistic approach to training ensures a true social transformation in the youth. The organisation has maintained an enviable 100% placement record since its inception since 2003 and has trained and placed more than 10,000 youth until date.The primary beneficiaries of our programme are the youth, particularly underprivileged youth who otherwise have no access to quality vocational training. Unnati programe is been replicated and established across PAN India, spread across 40 plus centers, during the year 2016-17 planning to come up with 60 centers across locations",
