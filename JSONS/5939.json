  "briefDescription": "In the early years, as greenhorns, we at SDD used to deal with diverse issues affecting the depressed sections, trying to find piecemeal solution to each of them. Nonetheless, with time we have got wiser and have realised that education is the key to alleviating all the ills afflicting the depressed masses. So now SDD is singleminded in its focus and takes up only those initiatives that go to improve the educational opportunities and facilities available for the children belonging to the depressed sections. Through these kind of programes SDD has achieved the following:- 200 children enrolled in the school through school enrollment campaign- 600 SSLC students get pass in the school final examination and they are the social change agents",
