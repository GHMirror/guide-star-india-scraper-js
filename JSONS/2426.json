  "briefDescription": "“NIPUN” - a Hindi word, meaning ‘one who is skilled’ - is a Non Government Organization founded primarily to enhance quality of life of the poor and the vulnerable, by a group of socially conscious development workers in 2005.  Children and youth are its target group, with physically and mentally challenged children and adults forming a priority category.  Pre, Non-formal and Remedial Schools, Community Health Programmes and Promotion of Self-Help Groups form its major strategies.NIPUN has made a modest beginning with community organization, enhancing skills of children and youth and educational activities in the slum areas in West Delhi. The approach of the organisation is to organise and sensitize members of the community about their developmental needs and initiate them to address those needs, develop their capacities, utilize local wisdom, encourage community participation, apportion and delegate responsibilities, develop linkages, maintain follow up and  feedback,  with emphasis on treating  family as the  basic unit for development.",
