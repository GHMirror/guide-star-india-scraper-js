  "briefDescription": "Project KHEL is a non-profit that works towards empowering adolescents, paving the way to a more equal and inclusive society.Project KHEL runs several programmes, in the form of either regular interventions 1 to 4 times each week with a fixed group of beneficiaries at various locations; or one-off workshops, training and events catering to a wider audience. In line with our belief in: a)\tadopting a preventive approach, b)\texperiential education, andc)\tPLAY for development, All our programmes look at engaging individuals and groups through interactive means, helping them reflect on their actions, encouraging them to make better, informed decisions, adopt a better behaviour, leading to a transformation in the individual and eventually transformation of a community.ENGAGE: We engage with children in a way that draws their interest to eventually accomplish development goals that we want to achieve.DO: We provide safe spaces to children using games, sports, role-playing, storytelling and similar interactive means where they feel comfortable participating by doing, being themselves, reveal their personalities, share their perspectives and open themselves to avail of the various educational and leadership opportunities we offer.REFLECT: After every activity, we help children reflect and understand how their thoughts and opinions could contribute to their lives and the larger society, encouraging children to think and speak critically, enabling them to make informed decisions in life.TRANSFORM: Empowering every child, helping them make better decisions based on information, logic and values, we hope to transform the society for the better, one child at a time.Other than delivering a structured Life Skills Education (LSE) curriculum through experiential education, the program builds awareness on important issues such as Civic Responsibility, Child Sexual Abuse (good and bad touches), Personal Hygiene and Self Presentation, Menstrual Hygiene Management, Safe Hand Washing, Peer Pressure, Tobacco and Substance Abuse, Dengue Awareness and so on.Apart from this regular programme, three additional programmes on Child Sexual Abuse (CSA), Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) and Puberty & Teen Issues are being implemented in workshop mode.Project KHELâ€™s fifth programme, JustKHELo is volunteer driven and aims to connect adults and underprivileged children on weekends and conduct organised play-based sessions.Since 2016, we have also been using the sport of Ultimate Frisbee at various locations as it is a unique self-officiated and mixed-gender sport.",
