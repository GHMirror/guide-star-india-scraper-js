  "briefDescription": "Prerana is a civil society organization that started working in the red light areas of Mumbai in 1986 with a view to eliminate second generation trafficking (ESGT) into commercial sexual exploitation (CSE&T) as we were shocked to see the ultimate plight of the children born to red light area based prostituted women victims and their inescapable recruitment in the organized flesh trade. In response to the situation, Prerana pioneered several path- breaking interventions, piloted them, evolved success story out of each intervention, and disseminated them for wide mainstreaming. We have served over 10,000 children till date.",
