The organization has networked with more than 50 organizations, hospitals, corporate and colleges.Shield Foundation is a vocational skilling arm. The objective was to train youth from economically disadvantaged backgrounds (age 18‚Äê35 years) and provide them with employable skills, coupled with access to employment and entrepreneurship opportunities. Today our programs enable youth to access entry-level positions and placements in 4 major vocations. Approximately 3,000 young people were reached in 2010-18 of whom 2,500 have been trained and placed either in entry level jobs or helped to start their own business.We conduct short-term courses, focusing on young men and women from urban slums. The model is based on strong industry linkages and youth counseling, and focuses on hands-on skills training.
