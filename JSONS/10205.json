  "briefDescription": "“We are hued in Western civilization.” “India is losing its past glory.” Where is Indian Culture & tradition?” “Indian youth are in dilemma.” and many more …… questions encounter us in the morning and we try to ignore it with the sip of the hot tea. It is now time to think and assess our behavior and deeds – this will certainly lead us to?We at Hope Line could not ignore this reality, and have to do something. With the Government license, much hard work, plus the direct help and dedication of many friends, We have managed to create something which is not only starting to address those issue directly but has also become a valuable and living part of youths and women.The point of debate –could we find the way out? The notion to solve out",
