  "briefDescription": "Shakti Shalini is Delhi based Non-Governmental Organization that has been actively working against all forms of gender and sexual violence since 1987. Gender and sexual violence is a critical social evil in India and needs concerted effort at individual, social and policy levels to bring about change. Shakti Shalini has a holistic and inclusive approach. We work with individuals, families and communities; with women, men, children and LGBTQ community members. Our mechanisms for promoting gender equality are four fold: Responding to Violence, Preventing Violence, Educational Enhancement programs to train future social workers, and Darmiyan, a Literature Platform dedicated to creating awareness for gender equality.",
