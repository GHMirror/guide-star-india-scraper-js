AKAT caters to the multiple needs of the poor at once by providing them with one-stop centres,through which slum residents have access to basic services.AKAT works with slum women and vulnerable people in urban and rural areas. Every person has a right to live life better. But when it comes to rural areas, it is a tough path for rural communities in terms of financial, social and educational aspects. AKA Trust addresses this gap by undertaking appropriate support programs, initiatives and social projects. The trust enables many of us to reach out to rural people and make a difference in their lives.",
