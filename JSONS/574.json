We work in 5 eco-regions of India with 1,526 Village institutions in 27 districts across six states and about a million households in protecting 107,094 hectares of revenue watelands, degraded forestlands and Panchayat grazing lands (Charagah lands). FES is probably the only organization that works on Commons at this scale.",
