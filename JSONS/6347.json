In this organization, we have a bunch of likeminded people including a team of doctors, social workers, literates, journalists, engineers and students who have extended their hands to work with co-operation and co-ordination, towards a better tomorrow.We are well aware that we will not be creating miracles and change everything around us all of a sudden. But we work with a dream which will come true with our efforts; we begin from the small basic level goals and aspire to walk towards achieving bigger goals with the due course of time.Currently we have Kodur as the centre for our work.",
