  "briefDescription": "We currently work on projects and programmes aimed at promoting and strengthening the livelihood, welfare and development of the poor tribal and rural communities of the Nilgiri District. This involves organising them, enhancing their capabilities, introducing new ways of improving their income and linking them to banks, markets and other health, welfare and economic services. Experienced professional teams based in the field use their skills and knowledge to alleviate poverty by working directly with these communities. The CTRD also formed self help groups of disabled people to help them organizing them selfs and increase their integration into society. A integrated complexe for elderly people and destitute children was built in 2012. We promote renewable energy through biogas units and thereby help fighting the climate change.",
