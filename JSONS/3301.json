  "briefDescription": "Reforestindia is an initiative of Rajanet Yegneswaran Charitable Trust, a not for profit, registered NGO with 80G, 12A and FCRA. Our aim is to contribute to global cooling by reforesting india and sequestering maximum amounts of carbon, in the shortest time possible, in the most effective manner. For we fully understand that trees/forests are the only natural carbon sinks that can actually cool the globe. Apart from global cooling, our efforts will also contribute with the other natural benefits of reforestation that include: increased biodiversity, increased biomass, increased precipitation, increased rainfall, increased groundwater levels, increased ability of the soil to retain and release water over longer periods of time, better watershed management and stabilisation of local climate. Reforestindia provides a much needed option to all citizens and corporates of the world to live a carbon neutral, guilt-free life by offsetting the emissions caused by their actions. We have planted over 60,000 trees in urban bangalore and rural areas around bangalore. We plant fruits tree orchards for farmers to improve their livelihood.",
