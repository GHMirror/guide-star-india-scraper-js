  "briefDescription": "Ummeed, meaning ‘hope’, is a non-profit organization set up with the objective of helping children with developmental disabilities. Ummeed was started by Dr. Vibha Krishnamurthy, who trained at Children’s Hospital, Boston, as a Developmental Pediatrician. After returning to India, the lack of facilities for children with developmental disabilities led her to set up Ummeed in November 2001. From an initial team size of four, Ummeed today is a 90+ member strong professional team.  Ummeed provides specialized care for most developmental disabilities and supports children and their families through clinical services and an early intervention center. It aims to influence the ecosystem by training parents, professionals, teachers, community workers and by, creating wider awareness, conducting research and engaging in advocacy events.Ummeed provides specialized care for most developmental disabilities and supports children and their families through four main areas of work:Clinical ServicesSupporting children in overcoming their disabilities through direct clinical services and helping families in their journey towards acceptance and empowerment.Training ServicesBuilding a cadre of trained professionals and community workers who can prevent, diagnose, and manage developmental disabilities more eﬀectively.ResearchPartnering with national and international organizations to foster research in developmental disabilitiesAwareness and AdvocacyActively participating in international committees, national groups and task forces, as well as advocating for inclusive schools and communities",
