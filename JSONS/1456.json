  "briefDescription": "Established in 1982, Development Alternatives, a non-profit research and development organization, innovates and disseminates sustainable solutions that aim to eliminate poverty, revive communities and regenerate the ecosystem's valuable services. DA's development solutions deliver basic needs products through the creation of small local enterprises that also generate significant numbers of jobs and incomes. These enterprises, based on innovative environment-friendly technologies and market principles, help build local economies and communities while maintaining a minimum ecological footprint.DA has pioneered methods to enable low-income countries to accelerate their development efforts and make these sustainable through economically attractive and environmentally sound technologies. The organization has innovated and implemented more than 20 types of business solutions based on green technology that have made a considerable beneficial impact on millions of poor and marginalized rural families. These are also appropriate for other developing countries in Asia and Africa.",
