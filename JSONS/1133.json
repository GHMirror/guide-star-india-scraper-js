  "briefDescription": "Toybank is registered as The Opentree Foundation and was founded on 15th of August, 2004. Vision – A World where all children are empowered through Healthy Play. Ethos – It’s easier to Build stronger children than to repair broken men. Our interventions focus on development and learning through play. We aim to provide safe and happy spaces for at-risk children who are otherwise mostly subject to negative environments. We believe that early childhood development programs are the most important investment to address inequality and improve outcomes later in life.",
