  "briefDescription": "Since 1977, the Community Outreach Programme (CORP) has worked to provide a platform for the holistic development of women, children, and the communities in which they live. At CORP, we believe that self-sufficiency, not dependence, is the key to a life of dignity and self-respect. It is this belief that gave birth to CORP more than 37 years ago, and it continues to be the common thread that binds our activities today.",
